# Double-Click Zoom Centering Fix - Version 2.2.1

## Problem Fixed
The double-click zoom feature was not properly centering the clicked point in the display after zooming. Users had to manually pan to see the area they clicked on, which defeated the purpose of centered zooming.

## Root Cause
The original centering logic had several issues:
1. **Incorrect coordinate transformation**: Not properly accounting for current scroll position when converting click coordinates to image coordinates
2. **Complex centering calculation**: Overly complicated logic that didn't handle the transition between fitted mode and 1:1 scale mode correctly
3. **Timing issues**: Centering calculations were happening before the image was fully redrawn

## Solution Implemented

### Simplified Coordinate System
- **Clear separation**: Separated the coordinate conversion logic for fitted mode vs 1:1 scale mode
- **Proper scroll handling**: Used `canvas.canvasx()` and `canvas.canvasy()` to properly account for current scroll position
- **Direct calculation**: Converted click coordinates directly to original image coordinates before zoom operation

### Improved Centering Algorithm
```python
def _center_image_point(self, image_x, image_y, target_canvas_x, target_canvas_y):
    # Calculate scaled coordinates after zoom
    scaled_x = image_x * self.zoom_level
    scaled_y = image_y * self.zoom_level
    
    # Calculate required scroll position to center the point
    desired_scroll_left = scaled_x - target_canvas_x
    desired_scroll_top = scaled_y - target_canvas_y
    
    # Convert to scroll fractions and apply
```

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Accurate Coordinate Conversion
- **In 1:1 Mode**: `abs_x = self.canvas.canvasx(click_canvas_x) / self.zoom_level`
- **In Fitted Mode**: Properly accounts for centering offset and current fitted scale

#### 2. Reliable Centering
- Uses the actual scroll region dimensions from the canvas
- Calculates exact scroll fractions needed to position the clicked point at the target location
- Handles edge cases where scrolling isn't needed (image smaller than canvas)

#### 3. Better Timing
- Increased delay from 1ms to 10ms: `self.root.after(10, lambda: ...)`
- Ensures the image is fully redrawn before attempting to center

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- Double-click would zoom but the clicked area might not be visible
- Users had to manually pan to find the zoomed area
- Inconsistent behavior between fitted mode and 1:1 scale mode

### After Fix:
- ✅ Double-click zooms and immediately shows the clicked area centered
- ✅ Works correctly from both fitted mode and 1:1 scale mode  
- ✅ Handles edge cases (clicks outside image, maximum zoom, etc.)
- ✅ No manual panning required after zoom
- ✅ Smooth and predictable user experience

## Code Changes

### Modified Methods:
1. **`_perform_centered_zoom()`**: Completely rewritten coordinate conversion logic
2. **`_center_image_point()`**: Replaced `_center_point_in_view()` with simpler, more reliable algorithm

### Technical Details:
- More accurate use of tkinter canvas coordinate system
- Proper handling of scroll region boundaries
- Simplified mathematical calculations for centering
- Better error handling for edge cases

## User Experience Impact
Users can now:
1. Double-click on any detail in an image (barcode, text, etc.)
2. Immediately see that detail centered and zoomed in 2x
3. Continue working without needing to pan or search for the zoomed area
4. Use Ctrl+double-click to zoom out while keeping the clicked point centered

This fix makes the zoom feature truly useful for detailed image inspection workflows.
