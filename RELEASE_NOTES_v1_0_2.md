# 📋 ImageLabelTool v1.0.2 Release Notes

## 🚀 Version Information
- **Version**: 1.0.2
- **Build Date**: October 6, 2025
- **Executable**: `ImageLabelTool_1_0_2.exe`
- **File Size**: 70.3 MB

## 🔧 Bug Fixes in v1.0.2

### ✅ Critical Fix: Infinite Loop Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: PyInstaller executable was creating infinite loops, spawning multiple application instances
- **Solution**: Added proper multiprocessing protection and restructured main execution block

#### Technical Fixes Applied:
1. **Added Multiprocessing Protection**
   ```python
   import multiprocessing
   multiprocessing.freeze_support()  # Prevents infinite loops in executables
   ```

2. **Restructured Main Execution Block**
   - Moved application logic to separate `main()` function
   - Improved PIL import error handling
   - Removed problematic re-imports in main block

3. **Disabled Matplotlib Imports**
   - Completely disabled optional matplotlib imports to prevent conflicts
   - Improved executable stability and reduced size

4. **Enhanced PyInstaller Configuration**
   - Added multiprocessing to hidden imports
   - Optimized import handling for better executable performance

## 🎯 Features Maintained
- ✅ Complete image classification functionality
- ✅ Progress and Analysis tabs interface  
- ✅ Folder path selection and image navigation
- ✅ CSV export with statistics
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for rapid labeling
- ✅ Parcel counting and progress tracking
- ✅ Auto-monitoring for new files
- ✅ Filter functionality by label types

## 🔒 Stability Improvements
- **No more infinite loops** when launching executable
- **Single instance execution** as expected
- **Improved memory management** with proper cleanup
- **Better error handling** for edge cases

## 📦 Deployment
- **Standalone executable**: No Python installation required
- **All dependencies included**: PIL, OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter
- **Windows compatible**: Tested on Windows 11
- **Portable**: Can be copied and run on any Windows machine

## 🧪 Testing Performed
- ✅ Unit tests for all critical fixes
- ✅ Import structure validation
- ✅ Multiprocessing protection verification
- ✅ Executable build and launch testing
- ✅ Core functionality verification

## 🚨 Known Issues Resolved
- ❌ ~~Infinite loop on executable launch~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
- ❌ ~~Multiple application instances spawning~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
- ❌ ~~Chart functionality conflicts~~ → ✅ **REMOVED for stability**
