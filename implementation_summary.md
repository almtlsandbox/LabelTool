# Todo.txt Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

All items from `todo.txt` have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Rename "Total groups" to "Total number of parcels"
- **Changed:** UI label from "Total Groups:" to "Total number of parcels:"
- **Changed:** Code comments and references updated throughout

### 2. Update "Auto Classification" frame title
- **Changed:** Frame title from "Auto Classification" to "Auto detect new files"

### 3. Rename "Group Summary" to "Parcel count"
- **Changed:** Statistics section header from "Group Summary" to "Parcel count"

### 4. Enhanced Parcel Count Statistics
**New display format includes:**
- Number of parcels: [count]
- Parcels with no code: [count] (all images classified as "no code")
- Parcels with read failure: [count] (at least one image classified as "read failure")
- Total readable parcels: [count] (calculated as: Total - no_code + read_failure)

### 5. Rename "Total analysis" to "Net Stats"
- **Changed:** Statistics section header from "Total Analysis" to "Net Stats"

### 6. Enhanced Read Statistics
**New "Net Stats" section includes:**
- **Gross read rate:** Shows actual parcels found vs. expected total
  - Format: `[actual]/[expected] ([percentage]%)`
- **Net read rate:** Shows parcels with read failure vs. total readable parcels
  - Format: `[read_failure_count]/[readable_total] ([percentage]%)`

## Example Output

### Parcel Count Section:
```
Number of parcels: 3
Parcels with no code: 2
Parcels with read failure: 1
Total readable parcels: 2
```

### Net Stats Section:
```
Gross read rate: 3/3 (100.0%)
Net read rate: 1/2 (50.0%)
```

## Technical Notes

- All calculations are based on parcel-level analysis (not individual image counts)
- Parcel classification follows existing logic where parcel is labeled based on the "worst case" image classification within that parcel
- Statistics update automatically when labels change
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified
- `image_label_tool.py` - Main application file with all UI and logic updates

## Testing Status
✅ All changes tested and working correctly
✅ No syntax errors
✅ Application initializes properly
✅ Statistics calculations verified with test data
